        "content": "The document appears to be a part of Uber's quarterly report (Form 10-Q) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It discusses various risks and challenges facing the company, including:\n\n1. Competition: Uber faces intense competition in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries from established players and new market entrants.\n2. Autonomous vehicles: The company is investing in autonomous vehicle technology, but there are significant risks and liabilities associated with its development and deployment.\n3. Regulatory environment: Governments are developing regulations for autonomous vehicles, which could impact Uber's ability to offer them on its platform.\n4. Driver classification: Uber may need to classify its drivers as employees or quasi-employees, which could affect its financial statements.\n5. Global expansion: The company is expanding globally, but faces challenges in entering new markets and competing with local players.\n\nThe document also discusses the terms of the company's Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) program, including:\n\n1. Timing of RSU election: Participants must make an RSU election by December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the election is to be effective.\n2. Effect of RSU election: The portion of compensation subject to the RSU election will be converted into an RSU award, with the number of shares underlying the award determined by dividing the dollar amount by the average daily closing price per share of Uber's common stock in the month prior to the conversion date.\n3. Vesting and issuance of RSU award: The shares underlying the RSU award will be fully vested and issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the conversion date, but no later than 60 days following the conversion date.\n\nOverall, the document provides insight into the challenges facing Uber's business and the terms of its employee compensation program.",

We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,\n\n63\n---\nincluding Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted. Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results. Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform.",

The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted. Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments. Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.",

Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 4.2.2. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make an RSU Election for services performed in the calendar year on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The RSU Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to Compensation earned with respect to services performed after the later of (a) the Effective Date, (b) the date on which the RSU Election Form is received by the Administrator, or (c) such later date as specified by the Administrator in the RSU Election Form. #### 4.3. Effect of RSU Election\n\nOn each date that Compensation would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the portion of the Compensation subject to the RSU Election (to the extent not subject to a Deferral Election) shall be converted from cash into an RSU Award by dividing the dollar amount subject to the RSU Election by the average daily closing price per Share of the Company’s common stock in the month prior to the Conversion Date to determine the number of Shares underlying the RSU Award, with any fractional Share rounded up to the next whole Share. #### 4.4. Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award\n\nTo the extent not subject to a Deferral Election, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying an RSU Award shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the Conversion Date, but in any event within 60 days following the Conversion Date. #### 4.5.",

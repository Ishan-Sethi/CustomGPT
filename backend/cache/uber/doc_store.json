All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:\\n\\n- the impacts of COVID-19 or other future pandemics on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows;\\n- our ability to successfully defend litigation and government proceedings brought against us, including with respect to our relationship with drivers and couriers, and the potential impact on our business operations and financial performance if we are not successful;\\n- our ability to successfully compete in highly competitive markets;\\n- our ability to effectively manage our growth and maintain and improve our corporate culture;\\n- our expectations regarding financial performance, including but not limited to revenue, potential profitability and the timing thereof, ability to generate positive Adjusted EBITDA, expenses, and other results of operations;\\n- our expectations regarding future operating performance, including but not limited to our expectations regarding future Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”), Trips, Gross Bookings, and Take Rate;\\n- our expectations regarding our competitors’ use of incentives and promotions, our competitors’ ability to raise capital, and the effects of such incentives and promotions on our growth and results of operations;\\n- our anticipated investments in new products and offerings, and the effect of these investments on our results of operations;\\n- our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements;\\n- our ability to close and integrate acquisitions into our operations;\\n- anticipated technology trends and developments and our ability to address those trends and developments with our products and offerings;\\n- the size of our addressable markets, market share, category positions, and market trends, including our ability to grow our business in the countries we have identified as expansion markets;\\n- the safety, affordability, and convenience of our platform and our offerings;\\n- our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel, including key members of senior management;\\n- our expected growth in the number of platform users, and our ability to promote our brand and attract and retain platform users;\\n- our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights;\\n- our ability to introduce new products and offerings and enhance existing products and offerings;\\n- our ability to successfully enter into new geographies, expand our presence in countries in which we are limited by regulatory restrictions, and manage our international expansion;\\n- our ability to successfully renew licenses to operate our business in certain jurisdictions;\\n- the availability of capital to grow our business;\\n- volatility in the business or stock price of our minority-owned affiliates;\\n- our ability to meet the requirements of our existing debt and draw on our line of credit;\\n- our ability to prevent disturbances to our information technology systems;\\n- our ability to comply with existing, modified, or new laws and regulations applying to our business; and\\n- our ability to implement, maintain, and improve our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nActual events or results may differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. As such, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our\\n---\\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strategy, and financial needs. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is\\nsubject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nMoreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us\\nto predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results,\\nevents and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ\\nmaterially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\\n\\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on\\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these\\nstatements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or\\nreview of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.\\n\\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date on which the statements are made.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nDescription of Business\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\\n\\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\n\\nBasis of Presentation\\n\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\\n---\\n## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19\\n\\nVarious governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions. These restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. COVID-19 has produced uncertainty around the world and it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\\n\\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,” which requires disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if the acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n## Note 2 – Revenue\\n\\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region. Revenue by geographical region is based on where the transaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Mobility revenue|$853|$2,518|\\n|Delivery revenue|$1,741|$2,512|\\n|Freight revenue|$301|$1,824|\\n|All Other revenue|$8|—|\\n|Total revenue|$2,903|$6,854|\\n\\n(1) We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (“Subscription”). We recognize Subscription fees ratably over the life of the pass. We allocate Subscription fees earned to Mobility and Delivery revenue on a proportional basis, based on usage for each offering during the respective period.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|United States and Canada (\\\"US&CAN\\\")|$1,849|$4,562|\\n|Latin America (\\\"LatAm\\\")|$302|$432|\\n|Europe, Middle East and Africa (\\\"EMEA\\\")|$225|$1,127|\\n|Asia Pacific (\\\"APAC\\\")|$527|$733|\\n|Total revenue|$2,903|$6,854|\\n\\n## Revenue\\n\\nMobility Revenue\\n\\nWe derive revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of our platform(s) and related services to facilitate and complete mobility services and, in certain markets, revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform. Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products.\\n---\\n## During the first quarter of 2022\\n\\nWe modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\n\\n## Delivery Revenue\\n\\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants’ and Couriers’ use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery transactions.\\n\\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $88 million and $241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $339 million and $740 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nDelivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\\n\\n## Freight Revenue\\n\\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”), and as a result, our Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.\\n\\n## All Other Revenue\\n\\nPrior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to our Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) business and revenue from our New Mobility offerings and products.\\n\\n## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation\\n\\nContract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, we had $155 million of contract liabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\\n\\nOur remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized as follows (in millions):\\n\\n| |Less Than or Equal To 12 Months|Greater Than 12 Months|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of March 31, 2022|$25|$121|$146|\\n\\n## Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement\\n\\nInvestments\\n\\nOur investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in millions):\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities (1)|$315|$306|\\n|Marketable equity securities:| | |\\n|Didi|$2,838|$1,410|\\n|Grab|$3,821|$1,876|\\n|Aurora|$3,388|$1,682|\\n|Other|$1,312|$843|\\n|Note receivable from a related party (1)|$132|$130|\\n|Investments|$11,806|$6,247|\\n\\n(1) These balances include certain investments recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings due to the election of the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\\n---\\n## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\n\\n| |As of December 31, 2021| | | |As of March 31, 2022| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Financial Assets|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Total|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Total|\\n|Non-marketable equity securities|$—|$—|$32|$32|$—|$—|$21|$21|\\n|Marketable equity securities|11,359|$—|$—|11,359|5,811|$—|$—|5,811|\\n|Note receivable from a related party|$—|$—|$132|$132|$—|$—|$130|$130|\\n|Total financial assets|$11,359|$—|$164|$11,523|$5,811|$—|$151|$5,962|\\n\\n|Financial Liabilities| | | | | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|MLU B.V. Call Option (1)|$—|$—|$193|$193|$—|$—|$12|$12|\\n|Total financial liabilities|$—|$—|$193|$193|$—|$—|$12|$12|\\n\\n(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\nWe measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\\n\\nDepending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\\n\\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.\\n\\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\\n\\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\\n\\n## Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\\n\\n| |Non-marketable Equity Securities|Note Receivables|MLU B.V. Call Option|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Balance as of December 31, 2021|$32|$132|$193|\\n|Change in fair value Included in earnings|(11)|(2)|(181)|\\n|Balance as of March 31, 2022|$21|$130|$12|\\n---\\n## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\n\\nNon-Financial Assets\\n\\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.\\n\\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\\n\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\\n\\nWe did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held, including cumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Initial cost basis|$279|$281|\\n|Upward adjustments|4|4|\\n|Downward adjustments (including impairment)|-|-|\\n|Total carrying value at the end of the period|$283|$285|\\n\\nNote 4 – Equity Method Investments\\n\\nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|MLU B.V.|$751|$574|\\n|Mission Bay 3 & 4|38|37|\\n|Other|11|13|\\n|Total equity method investments|$800|$624|\\n\\nMLU B.V. Investment\\n\\nWe reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\\n\\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\\n\\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying value of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.’s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.\\n---\\n| |Mobility|Delivery|Freight|Total Goodwill|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Balance as of December 31, 2021|$2,581|$4,401|$1,438|$8,420|\\n|Acquisitions|64|—|—|64|\\n|Measurement period adjustment|—|—|5|5|\\n|Foreign currency translation adjustment|-56|2|—|-54|\\n|Balance as of March 31, 2022|$2,589|$4,403|$1,443|$8,435|\\n---\\n## Intangible Assets\\n\\n| |Gross Carrying Value|Accumulated Amortization|Net Carrying Value|Useful Life - Years|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Consumer, Merchant and other relationships|$1,868|$(294)|$1,574|9|\\n|Developed technology|$922|$(269)|$653|5|\\n|Trade names and trademarks|$222|$(47)|$175|6|\\n|Patents|$15|$(7)|$8|7|\\n|Other|$5|$(3)|$2|0|\\n\\n| |Gross Carrying Value|Accumulated Amortization|Net Carrying Value|Useful Life - Years|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Consumer, Merchant and other relationships|$1,856|$(362)|$1,494|9|\\n|Developed technology|$924|$(325)|$599|5|\\n|Trade names and trademarks|$222|$(55)|$167|6|\\n|Patents|$15|$(8)|$7|6|\\n|Other|$5|$(3)|$2|0|\\n\\nAmortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was $92 million and $144 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nThe estimated aggregate future amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization as of March 31, 2022 is summarized below (in millions):\\n\\n|Year Ending December 31,|Estimated Future Amortization Expense|\\n|---|---|\\n|Remainder of 2022|$381|\\n|2023|$363|\\n|2024|$306|\\n|2025|$266|\\n|2026|$203|\\n|Thereafter|$748|\\n|Total|$2,267|\\n---\\n## Note 6 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements\\n\\n|Components of debt|December 31, 2021|As of March 31, 2022|Effective Interest Rates|Maturities|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|2025 Refinanced Term Loan|$1,448|$1,444|3.8%|April 4, 2025|\\n|2027 Refinanced Term Loan|$1,090|$1,087|3.8%|February 25, 2027|\\n|2025 Senior Note|$1,000|$1,000|7.7%|May 15, 2025|\\n|2026 Senior Note|$1,500|$1,500|8.1%|November 1, 2026|\\n|2027 Senior Note|$1,200|$1,200|7.7%|September 15, 2027|\\n|2028 Senior Note|$500|$500|7.0%|January 15, 2028|\\n|2029 Senior Note|$1,500|$1,500|4.7%|August 15, 2029|\\n|2025 Convertible Notes|$1,150|$1,150|0.2%|December 15, 2025|\\n\\nTotal debt: $9,388 (December 31, 2021) and $9,381 (March 31, 2022)\\n\\nLess: unamortized discount and issuance costs: ($85) and ($81)\\n\\nLess: current portion of long-term debt: ($27) and ($27)\\n\\nTotal long-term debt: $9,276 (December 31, 2021) and $9,273 (March 31, 2022)\\n\\n2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loans Refinancing\\n\\nOn February 25, 2021, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $2.6 billion pursuant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement, the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all previously outstanding loans under the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement and the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement. The $2.6 billion is comprised of (i) a $1.1 billion tranche with a maturity date of February 25, 2027, replacing the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan as a Refinancing Term Loan (the “2027 Refinanced Term Loan”), and (ii) a $1.5 billion tranche with a maturity date of April 4, 2025, replacing the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan as an Incremental Term Loan (the “2025 Refinanced Term Loan”). The refinancing transaction qualified as a debt modification that did not result in an extinguishment.\\n\\nThe 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022. The loan is secured by certain of our intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.\\n\\nThe fair values of our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2022 and were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\n\\n2025 Convertible Notes\\n\\nIn December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\\n\\nHolders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined below) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call such notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after September 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\\n---\\n## As of March 31, 2022\\n\\nNone of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.\\n\\nThe initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.\\n\\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\\n\\nThe indenture governing the 2025 Convertible\\n---\\n## The following table presents the amount of interest expense recognized relating to the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs with respect to our long-term debt, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n|Contractual interest coupon|$ 2021 111 $ 2022 133|\\n|Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs|7 4|\\n|Total interest expense from long-term debt|$ 118 $ 137|\\n\\nRevolving Credit Arrangements\\n\\nWe have a revolving credit agreement initially entered in 2015 with certain lenders, which provides for $2.3 billion in credit maturing on June 13, 2023 (\\\"Revolving Credit Facility\\\"). On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) provide for approximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, (iii) reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (\\\"LIBOR\\\") based interest rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\\\"SOFR\\\") based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit agreement contains customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintain a certain level of liquidity specified in the contractual agreement. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the payment of dividends. As of March 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility.\\n\\nLetters of Credit\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had letters of credit outstanding of $749 million and $741 million, respectively, of which the letters of credit that reduced the available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility were $247 million and $239 million, respectively.\\n---\\n## Note 7 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information\\n\\n### Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Prepaid expenses|$459|$355|\\n|Other receivables|$553|$615|\\n|Other|$442|$492|\\n|Prepaid expenses and other current assets|$1,454|$1,462|\\n\\n### Accrued and Other Current Liabilities\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Accrued legal, regulatory and non-income taxes|$2,187|$2,066|\\n|Accrued Drivers and Merchants liability|$1,187|$1,222|\\n|Income and other tax liabilities|$376|$393|\\n|Commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes in connection with Careem acquisition|$238|$234|\\n|Other|$2,549|$2,251|\\n|Accrued and other current liabilities|$6,537|$6,166|\\n\\n### Other Long-Term Liabilities\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Deferred tax liabilities|$365|$91|\\n|Other|$570|$588|\\n|Other long-term liabilities|$935|$679|\\n\\n### Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\\n\\n| |Unrealized Gains (Losses)|\\n|---|---|\\n| |Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments|on Available-for-Sale Securities, Net of Tax|Total|\\n|Balance as of December 31, 2020|($581)|$46|($535)|\\n|Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications| |$33|$1,156|$1,189|\\n|Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)| | | |\\n|Other comprehensive income (loss)|$33|$1,156|$1,189|\\n|Balance as of March 31, 2021|($548)|$1,202|$654|\\n\\n(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2021, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax relates to pre-tax unrealized gains of $1.3 billion for the change in fair value of our investment in Grab.

Following our IPO in 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).\\n\\nStock Option and SAR Activity\\n\\nA summary of stock option and SAR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, per share amounts, and years):\\n\\n| |Options Outstanding|Weighted-Average Exercise Price Per Share|Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years)|Aggregate Intrinsic Value|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|As of December 31, 2021|157|$11.84|4.35|$735|\\n|Granted|4|$33.89| | |\\n|Exercised|(3)|$5.20| | |\\n|Canceled and forfeited| |$14.17| | |\\n|As of March 31, 2022|158|$12.51|4.10|$558|\\n|Vested and expected to vest as of March 31, 2022|141|$8.31|3.36|$473|\\n|Exercisable as of March 31, 2022|141|$8.31|3.36|$473|\\n\\nRSU Activity\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our RSUs for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\\n\\n| |Number of Shares|Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Unvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2021|71,461|$41.91|\\n|Granted|59,266|$33.65|\\n|Vested|(9,699)|$39.24|\\n|Canceled and forfeited|(4,073)|$39.87|\\n|Unvested and outstanding as of March 31, 2022|116,955|$37.99|\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\\n\\nStock-based compensation expense is allocated based on the cost center to which the award holder belongs. The following table summarizes total stock-based compensation expense by function (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31|\\n|---|---|\\n|Operations and support|$2021 28|$2022 33|\\n|Sales and marketing| |22|22|\\n|Research and development| |133|196|\\n|General and administrative| |98|108|\\n|Total|$281|$359|\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, there was $4.5 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.91 years.\\n---\\n## The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\\n\\nWe compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\\n\\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.\\n\\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\\n\\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\\n\\nNote 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\\n\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\\n\\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.\\n---\\n## The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Basic net loss per share:|2021|2022| |\\n|Numerator| | | |\\n|Net loss including non-controlling interests|$(122)|$(5,918)| |\\n|Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax|(14)|12| |\\n|Net loss attributable to common stockholders|$(108)|$(5,930)| |\\n|Denominator| | | |\\n|Basic weighted-average common stock outstanding|1,858,525|1,953,989| |\\n|Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (1)|$(0.06)|$(3.03)| |\\n|Diluted net loss per share:| | | |\\n|Numerator| | | |\\n|Net loss attributable to common stockholders|$(108)|$(5,930)| |\\n|Net loss attributable to Freight Holding convertible common shares non-controlling interest, net of tax| |$(13)| |\\n|Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders|$(108)|$(5,943)| |\\n|Denominator| | | |\\n|Number of shares used in basic net loss per share computation|1,858,525|1,953,989| |\\n|Weighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities:| | | |\\n|Assumed redemption of Freight Holding convertible common shares, non-controlling interest| |3,742| |\\n|Diluted weighted-average common stock outstanding|1,858,525|1,957,731| |\\n|Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (1)|$(0.06)|$(3.04)| |\\n\\n(1) Per share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.\\n\\n## The following potentially dilutive outstanding securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the period (in thousands):\\n\\n| |2021 As of March 31,|2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Freight Holdings contingently redeemable preferred stock|13,586|12,377|\\n|Convertible notes|22,013|18,503|\\n|RSUs|82,146|116,955|\\n|Stock options|26,073|23,587|\\n|Common stock subject to repurchase|28|3,767|\\n|Shares committed under ESPP|2,084|3,361|\\n|Warrants to purchase common stock|126|73|\\n|Total|146,056|178,623|\\n---\\n## Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information\\n\\nWe determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.\\n\\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\\n\\n|Segment|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis.

Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.\\n\\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table below). The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\\n\\n|Segment adjusted EBITDA:|Three Months Ended March 31,|2021|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Mobility|$298|$618| |\\n|Delivery|($200)|$30| |\\n|Freight|($29)|$2| |\\n|All Other|($11)|—| |\\n|Total segment adjusted EBITDA|$58|$650| |\\n\\nReconciling items:\\n\\n|Corporate G&A and Platform R&D|(1), (2)|($417)|($482)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Depreciation and amortization| |($212)|($254)|\\n|Stock-based compensation expense| |($281)|($359)|\\n|Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements| |($551)|—|\\n|Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets| |($57)|($13)|\\n|Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses| |($36)|($14)|\\n|Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets| |($2)|—|\\n|COVID-19 response initiatives| |($26)|($1)|\\n|Loss on lease arrangements, net| | |($7)|\\n|Restructuring and related charges| | |($2)|\\n\\nLoss from operations: ($1,524) in 2021 and ($482) in 2022\\n\\n(1) Excluding stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n(2) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments. Corporate G&A also includes certain shared costs such as finance, accounting, tax, human resources, information technology and legal costs. Platform R&D also includes mapping and payment technologies and support and development of the internal technology infrastructure. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.\\n---\\n## Geographic Information\\n\\nRevenue by geography is based on where the trip or shipment was completed or meal delivered. The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n|United States|$ 2021 1,683|$ 2022 4,197|\\n|All other countries|1,220|2,657|\\n|Total revenue|$ 2,903|$ 6,854|\\n\\nRevenue grouped by offerings and geographical region is included in Note 2 – Revenue.\\n\\n## Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\\n\\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nDriver Classification\\n\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\n\\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\\n\\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\\n\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\\n\\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\\n\\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a\\n---\\nstipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with the trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matter pending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. Since the assignment of the coordination judge, the case remains stayed as to discovery. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\\n\\nIn addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\\n\\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\\n\\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in which we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\\n\\nSwiss Social Security Reclassification\\n\\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact on our current operations. A ruling on the merits by the Federal Tribunal is expected in 2023. The ultimate resolution of the matters appealed before the Federal Tribunal is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\\n\\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\\n\\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law purposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.\\n\\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\\n\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these matters within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nOther Driver Classification Matters\\n\\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is\\n---\\nsupported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\\n\\n## State Unemployment Taxes\\n\\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\n## Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\\n\\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google’s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March 26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski. Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was formally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski’s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May 16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain given the possibility of appeals, we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\n## Non-Income Tax Matters\\n\\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such Drivers.\\n\\nWe are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we charge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment to the Tax Court (“pay-to-play”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.\\n\\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\\n\\n29\\n---\\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\\n\\nWe have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices, compliance with antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We have investigated many of these matters and we are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.\\n\\nIndemnifications\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions, we may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\\n\\nNote 13 – Variable Interest Entities\\n\\nVariable interest entities (“VIEs”) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.\\n\\nConsolidated VIEs\\n\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these VIEs.\\n\\n| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total assets|$3.9 billion|$4.2 billion|\\n|Total liabilities|$1.0 billion|$1.2 billion|\\n\\nFreight Holding\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, we own the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding and report a non-controlling interest as further described in Note 14 – Non-Controlling Interests.\\n\\nCareem Qatar\\n\\nThe assets and operations in Careem Qatar had not been transferred to us as of March 31, 2022. Transfer of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar will be subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval. We have rights to all residual interests in the Careem Qatar entity which is considered a variable interest. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity.\\n\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\n\\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Our carrying amount of assets recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to unconsolidated VIEs was $598 million and $605 million as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively, and represents our maximum exposure to loss associated with the unconsolidated VIEs.\\n\\nLime\\n\\nNeutron Holdings, Inc. (“Lime”) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by consumers for personal transportation. On May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP business and acquired ownership in Lime comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). We are exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards through our ownership of the 2020 Lime Investments, which represent variable interests.\\n\\nMoove\\n\\nGarment Investments S.L. dba Moove (“Moove”) is a vehicle fleet operator in Spain. On February 12, 2021, we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Moove including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, in which we acquired a\\n---\\n## 30% minority interest in Moove\\n\\nfrom its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a term loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial partnership agreement. After this series of agreements, Moove is considered a related party. We are exposed to Moove’s economic risks and rewards through our equity investment, the term loan and commercial partnership agreement, which represent variable interests.\\n\\n## Note 14 – Non-Controlling Interests\\n\\nFreight Holding\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we owned 78% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or 75% on a fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and outstanding. The minority stockholders of Freight Holding include: (i) holders of Freight Holding’s Series A and A-1 Preferred Stock; (ii) holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equity incentive plans; and (iii) employees who hold fully vested shares.\\n\\n## Note 15 – Divestiture\\n\\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\n\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\\n\\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated Liquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora.\\n\\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\\n\\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue to vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration for these future obligations to Aurora.\\n\\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this transaction. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, results of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. The resulting gain on disposal was recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\\n\\nThe following table presents the gain on sale of the ATG Business (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|1,277|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Fair value of common shares received| | |\\n|Derecognition of ATG Business' non-controlling interests| |1,057|\\n|Liability recognized for future obligations| |(315)|\\n|Net consideration received for sale of the ATG Business| |2,019|\\n|Carrying value of net assets transferred| |(375)|\\n|Gain on the sale of the ATG Business| |1,644|\\n---\\n## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In\\n---\\nclaims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\\n\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.\\n\\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\\n\\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n\\n## Financial and Operational Highlights\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31|% Change|(1)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change (Constant Currency)|\\n|Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) (2)|98|115|17%|\\n|Trips (2)|1,447|1,713|18%|\\n|Gross Bookings (2)|$19,536|$26,449|35%|\\n|Revenue|$2,903|$6,854|136%|\\n|Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.

The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022 with the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform increasing from 111 million in January 2022 to 121 million in March 2022.\\n---\\n## Overall Gross Bookings\\n\\nIncreased to $26.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, or 39% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2021.\\n\\n## Mobility Gross Bookings\\n\\nGrew 62% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19.\\n\\n## Delivery Gross Bookings\\n\\nGrew 15% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, outpacing Delivery Trip growth, as we saw a 3% increase in basket sizes globally driven by stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19.\\n\\n## Revenue\\n\\nWas $6.9 billion, up 136% year-over-year, with a Take Rate of 25.9%. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in our Freight business due to the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) during the fourth quarter of 2021, the favorable impact to revenue of $200 million due to a change in the accounting model for our UK Mobility business, as well as a favorable comparative impact to the same period in 2021 where, during the first quarter of 2021, revenue was reduced by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.\\n\\n## Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nWas $5.9 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net of $5.6 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $1.9 billion unrealized loss on our Grab investment; a $1.7 billion unrealized loss on our Aurora investments; a $1.4 billion unrealized loss on our Didi investment; and a $462 million unrealized loss on our Zomato investment. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $359 million of stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n## Adjusted EBITDA\\n\\nWas $168 million, up $527 million compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit improved by 107%, year-over-year, to $618 million. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $30 million, up $230 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $200 million in the same period in 2021. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\\n\\n## Other Developments\\n\\nCOVID-19\\n\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities’ and states’ declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\\n\\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\\n\\nTo comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended, our shared Mobility offering, in most markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability.\\n\\nWe are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any future waves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the further impact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n---\\n## Components of Results of Operations\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\n\\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” and “Note 2 - Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Note 2 – Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n\\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\\n\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\\n\\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip volume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located data center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\n\\nOperations and Support\\n\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\\n\\nSales and Marketing\\n\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\\n\\nResearch and Development\\n\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\\n\\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a decrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business.\\n\\n35\\n---\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.\\n\\n## Depreciation and Amortization\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\\n\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.\\n\\n## Interest Expense\\n\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.\\n\\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\\n\\n- Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\\n- Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\\n- Gain on business divestiture.\\n- Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.\\n- Impairment of equity method investment.\\n- Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V. Call Option”).\\n- Other, net.\\n\\n## Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.\\n\\n## Equity Method Investments\\n\\nEquity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n---\\n## Results of Operations\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n|Revenue|$ 2021 2,903 $ 2022 6,854|\\n|Costs and expenses| |\\n|Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below|1,710 4,026|\\n|Operations and support|423 574|\\n|Sales and marketing|1,103 1,263|\\n|Research and development|515 587|\\n|General and administrative|464 632|\\n|Depreciation and amortization|212 254|\\n|Total costs and expenses|4,427 7,336|\\n|Loss from operations|(1,524) (482)|\\n|Interest expense|(115) (129)|\\n|Other income (expense), net|1,710 (5,557)|\\n|Income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investments|71 (6,168)|\\n|Provision for (benefit from) income taxes|185 (232)|\\n|Income (loss) from equity method investments|(8) 18|\\n|Net loss including non-controlling interests|(122) (5,918)|\\n|Less: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax|(14) 12|\\n|Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.|$ (108) $ (5,930)|\\n\\n## Components as a Percentage of Revenue\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n|Revenue|2021 100% 2022 100%|\\n|Costs and expenses| |\\n|Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below|59% 59%|\\n|Operations and support|15% 8%|\\n|Sales and marketing|38% 18%|\\n|Research and development|18% 9%|\\n|General and administrative|16% 9%|\\n|Depreciation and amortization|7% 4%|\\n|Total costs and expenses|152% 107%|\\n|Loss from operations|(52)% (7)%|\\n|Interest expense|(4)% (2)%|\\n|Other income (expense), net|59% (81)%|\\n|Income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss) from equity method investments|2% (90)%|\\n|Provision for (benefit from) income taxes|6% (3)%|\\n|Income (loss) from equity method investments|—% —%|\\n|Net loss including non-controlling interests|(4)% (86)%|\\n|Less: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax|—% —%|\\n|Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.|(4)% (87)%|\\n\\n(1) Totals of percentage of revenues may not foot due to rounding.\\n---\\n## The following discussion and analysis is for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change|\\n|Revenue|$2,903|$6,854|136%|\\n\\nRevenue increased $4.0 billion, or 136%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 35%, or 39% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, and a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was unfavorably impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers. We also saw a $304 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, we saw a $200 million increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change|\\n|Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization|$1,710|$4,026|135%|\\n\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $2.3 billion, or 135%, mainly due to a $1.4 billion increase in Freight carrier payments and incentives resulting from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021, a $355 million increase in Courier payments and incentives in certain markets, a $313 million increase in insurance expense primarily due to an increase in miles driven in our Mobility business, and a $160 million increase in Driver payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a result of business model changes in the UK.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change|\\n|Operations and support|$423|$574|36%|\\n\\nOperations and support expenses increased $151 million, or 36%, primarily attributable to an $87 million increase in employee headcount costs, $35 million increase in external contractor expenses, and a $5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change|\\n|Sales and marketing|$1,103|$1,263|15%|\\n\\nSales and marketing expenses increased $160 million, or 15%, primarily attributable to a $72 million increase in consumer advertising expenses as well as an increase in consumer discounts, rider-facing loyalty expense, promotions, credits, and refunds of $64 million to $649 million compared to $585 million in the same period in 2021.\\n---\\n## Research and Development\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change| |\\n|Research and development|$515|$587|14%| |\\n|Percentage of revenue|18%|9%| | |\\n\\nResearch and development expenses increased $72 million, or 14%, primarily attributable to a $63 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change| |\\n|General and administrative|$464|$632|36%| |\\n|Percentage of revenue|16%|9%| | |\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $168 million, or 36%, primarily attributable to a $54 million increase in employee headcount costs, a net $49 million increase in legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, a $12 million increase in external contractor expenses, in addition to a $10 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n## Depreciation and Amortization\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change| |\\n|Depreciation and amortization|$212|$254|20%| |\\n|Percentage of revenue|7%|4%| | |\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $42 million, or 20%, primarily attributable to additional amortization expenses related to Transplace, Drizly, and Postmates intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation for fixed assets that fully depreciated in 2021.\\n\\n## Interest Expense\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change| |\\n|Interest expense|($115)|($129)|12%| |\\n|Percentage of revenue|(4)%|(2)%| | |\\n\\nInterest expense increased by an immaterial amount.\\n\\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|2021|2022|% Change| |\\n|Interest income|$5|$11|120%| |\\n|Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net|($25)|$10|**| |\\n|Gain on business divestiture|$1,684|—|**| |\\n|Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net|$63|($5,570)|**| |\\n|Impairment of equity method investment|—|($182)|**| |\\n|Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option|—|$181|**| |\\n|Other, net|($17)|($7)|59%| |\\n|Other income (expense), net|$1,710|($5,557)|**| |\\n|Percentage of revenue|59%|(81)%| | |\\n\\n** Percentage not meaningful.\\n---\\n## Gain on Business Divestiture\\n\\nGain on business divestiture decreased primarily due a $1.6 billion gain on the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora recognized in the first quarter of 2021.

Business model changes in the UK that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue also benefited Mobility revenue by $200 million. Additionally, Mobility revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.\\n---\\n## Mobility Segment\\n\\nMobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by a $281 million increase in insurance expense as a result of an increase in miles driven and a $76 million increase in credit card processing costs.\\n\\n## Delivery Segment\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Delivery revenue increased $771 million, or 44%, and Delivery adjusted EBITDA grew $230 million, or 115%.\\n\\nDelivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 15%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Take Rate improved to 18.1% from 14.0% compared to the same period in 2021 driven by an overall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\\n\\nDelivery adjusted EBITDA improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by a $387 million increase in cost of revenue as well as a $94 million increase in consumer promotions and employee headcount costs.\\n\\n## Freight Segment\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Freight revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 506%, and Freight adjusted EBITDA grew $31 million, or 107%.\\n\\nFreight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is also driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.\\n\\nFreight adjusted EBITDA improvement is attributable to a $1.5 billion improvement in Freight revenue, partially offset by $1.4 billion of certain shipper payments and incentives recorded in cost of revenue and an $88 million increase in employee headcount costs.\\n\\n## Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about how we use these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\n\\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\\n\\n| |Q2 2020|Q3 2020|Q4 2020|Q1 2021|Q2 2021|Q3 2021|Q4 2021|Q1 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |55|78|93|98|101|109|118|115|\\n\\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\\n---\\n## Trips (in millions)\\n\\n| |737|1,184|1,443|1,447|1,511|1,641|1,769|1,713|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Q2 2020|Q3 2020|Q4 2020|Q1 2021|Q2 2021|Q3 2021|Q4 2021|Q1 2022|\\n\\nGross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides; Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers.

See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our definition and a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|2021|2022|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(In millions, except percentages)|Adjusted EBITDA|$(359)|$168|**|\\n\\n** Percentage not meaningful.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $168 million, improving $527 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $359 million in the same period in 2021. The improvement was primarily attributable to a $320 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $230 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $31 million increase in Freight Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $65 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.\\n---\\n## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\\n\\nWe believe that both\\n---\\n## Adjusted EBITDA Exclusions:\\n\\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations;\\n- Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\\n- Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity securities; and\\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.\\n\\n## Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\\n\\n|(In millions)|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.|$(108)|$(5,930)|\\n|Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax|(14)|12|\\n|Provision for (benefit from) income taxes|185|(232)|\\n|Loss (income) from equity method investments|8|(18)|\\n|Interest expense|115|129|\\n|Other (income) expense, net|(1,710)|5,557|\\n|Depreciation and amortization|212|254|\\n|Stock-based compensation expense|281|359|\\n|Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements|551|—|\\n|Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets|57|13|\\n|Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses|36|14|\\n|Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets|2|—|\\n|COVID-19 response initiatives|26|1|\\n|Loss on lease arrangements, net|—|7|\\n|Restructuring and related charges|—|2|\\n|Adjusted EBITDA|$(359)|$168|\\n\\n## Constant Currency:\\n\\nWe compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\n---\\n## Free Cash Flow\\n\\nWe define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.

Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\\n---\\n## For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates\\n\\nSee the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n\\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n\\n## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\\n\\n### Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\n### Investment Risk\\n\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\\n\\n### Foreign Currency Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\\n\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\\n\\n## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “\\n---\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our\\n---\\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\\n\\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\n\\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\\n\\n### Risk Factor Summary\\n\\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\\n\\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business.\\n- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\\n- The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\\n- To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\\n- We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\n- If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\\n- Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\n- Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.\\n- If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\\n- Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\\n- We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n\\n50\\n---\\n## Risks Related to Our Business\\n\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.\\n\\nWe may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nWe may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\\n\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.\\n\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\n\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\n\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\n\\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\\n\\n## General Economic Risks\\n\\nThe coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility\\n---\\noffering may not recover to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, as such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required and may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models of our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\\n\\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nOperational Risks\\n\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\\n\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\\n\\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\\n\\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\\n\\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\\n\\n52\\n---\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\n\\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\\n\\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\\n\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\\n\\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our\\n---\\n### products.\\n\\nIncreased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\\n\\n### We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\\n\\n|Mobility|Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Delivery|Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.|\\n|Freight|Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.|\\n\\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\\n\\nWe are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India with respect to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographic markets. In addition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.\\n\\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummate them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or part of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.\\n\\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively would have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance.\\n\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer\\n---\\n### discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance.\\n\\nAdditionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.\\n\\n### The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized.\\n\\nMoreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\\n\\n### We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.\\n\\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\n\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.\\n\\n### If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that we experience in that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and this\\n---\\n# concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more important to service quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors’ products achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.\\n\\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.\\n\\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\\n\\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\\n\\n56\\n---\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\n\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.\\n\\nWe have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\\n\\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\\n\\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\n\\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n\\nOur historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we\\n---\\nhave since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated or managed to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such reorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.\\n\\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\\n\\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\\n\\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31, 2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business.\\n\\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\\n\\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through third-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the\\n---\\nqualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.\\n\\nIf Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise engaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\\n\\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\\n\\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\\n\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n\\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc., which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest significant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\\n\\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or\\n---\\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 75% of all Trips. We have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to expand our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be successful and may negatively affect our operating results.\\n\\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\\n\\n- operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\\n- the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\\n- laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services, payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information, ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;\\n- competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\\n- differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\\n- differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\\n- exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\\n- legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a lack of clear legal precedent;\\n- difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\\n- fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\\n- managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\\n- regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n- adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\\n- increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\\n- difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and jurisdictions;\\n- import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\\n- political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;\\n---\\n# public health concerns or emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\\n\\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\\n\\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\n# We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\\n\\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\\n\\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of Didi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi and Zomato. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.\\n\\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\\n\\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market for any of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\\n---\\n## We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results.\\n\\nIf we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\n\\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects. Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:\\n\\n- grow supply and demand on our platform;\\n- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\\n- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\\n- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\\n- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\\n- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\\n- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\\n- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\\n- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\\n- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\\n- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\\n- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\\n- increase positive perception of our brand.\\n\\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties.\\n---\\nfailure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\\n\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in pe United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in pe United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in pese large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weaper, and regulatory conditions or oper circumstances in each of pese large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or oper viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in pe desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in pe travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to healp concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from pese areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of pese key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree pan would pe occurrence of such events in oper areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations wipin pese key metropolitan areas pat affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in pese markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furpermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as pe publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nFurper, we expect pat we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, pe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in pe future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\\n\\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips pat eiper started or were completed at an airport. As a result of pis concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes pat impact pe ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of pe COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing pe demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or oper travel-related healp concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing wipin airport boundaries, including by mandating pat ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly pose outside pe United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogeper. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking pe requisite permits. Such actions may result in pe imposition of fines or sanctions, including furper bans on our ability to operate wipin airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, pe number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements wip most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside pe United States to allow pe use of our platform wipin airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee pat we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements wip airports in all jurisdictions.\\n\\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora,\\n\\n63\\n---\\nincluding Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results.\\n\\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could become subject to substantial fines or penalties.\\n\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees. Our employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our “return to office” plan, which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\\n\\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior management or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\\n\\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our business differently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus, operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\\n\\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects could be adversely affected.\\n\\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to\\n\\n64\\n---\\nattract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\\n\\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\\n\\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\\n\\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\\n\\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may continue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\\n\\nIf we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\\n\\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ license numbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are an attractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.\\n\\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizable until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures may misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or\\n\\n65\\n---\\n### mitigate the impact of any such breaches, including potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\\n\\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\\n\\n### If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\\n\\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.\\n\\n### We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics.\\n\\nCertain of our operational\\n---\\nused across large populations globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\\n\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences.\\n\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries). In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\\n\\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.\\n\\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.\\n\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\\n---\\n## business, and operating results.\\n\\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.\\n\\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\\n\\nOur platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\\n---\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\\n\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\n\\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to dedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\n\\nDependencies on Third Parties\\n\\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.\\n\\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.\\n\\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform\\n---\\nwill maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control. One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected. The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\\n\\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business. We use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially\\n---\\nreasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business. Our use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\\n\\nWe use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\\n\\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\\n\\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\\n\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.\\n\\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $234 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of March 31, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\\n---\\n#\\n\\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.\\n\\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive\\n---\\n## Changes in Tax Legislation\\n\\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, and modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections. This uncertainty could impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\\n\\nBeginning on January 1, 2022, the Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period, requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these expenses. Although there are discussions about deferring this requirement, there is no guarantee of any changes. If not repealed or modified, this legislation could adversely impact our financials.\\n\\n## Future Tax Reforms\\n\\nWe are unable to predict future global or U.S. tax reforms and their effects on our business. Any changes in tax legislation, regulations, or policies could increase our tax liability, affect our financial position, operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates, and increase the complexity and cost of tax compliance.\\n\\nWe are also subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, including digital services taxes in jurisdictions where we operate. New laws could increase our tax obligations or change how we operate our business, potentially harming our financials.\\n\\n## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax and state income tax purposes. The expiration of these carryforwards depends on our future taxable income. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, our ability to use these carryforwards may be limited if an “ownership change” occurs, potentially increasing our future tax liability.\\n\\n## Currency Exchange Rates\\n\\nDue to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations can impact our financial results, and while we may enter into hedging arrangements in the future, they may not completely eliminate the risks associated with currency exchange rate changes.\\n\\n## Business Acquisitions\\n\\nOur strategy includes acquiring companies, and the success of these acquisitions is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm our operating results and prospects. Additionally, any acquired businesses may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\n---\\nform joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates, Drizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\\n\\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.\\n\\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\\n\\n- diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\\n- disrupting our ongoing business operations;\\n- platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;\\n- implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\\n- integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\\n- retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\\n- maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\\n- integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\\n- integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\\n- liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\\n- litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\\n- impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\\n\\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions. For example, with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and each company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.\\n\\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\\n\\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether\\n\\n74\\n---\\nthese transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\\n\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\\n\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, Soup Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply wip pe license or permit requirements or risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict wheper future regulatory decisions or legislation in oper jurisdictions may embolden or encourage oper auporities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to pe terms of an existing license or permit.\\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us to comply wip regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and oper requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after pe regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as pose provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, pese regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in pe future. In August 2018, pe New York City Council voted to approve various measures to furper regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like pose enabled via our platform, while pe city studies wheper a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In August 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruising cap,” intended to reduce pe number of for-hire vehicles operating wipout passengers on platforms like ours in pe central business district of New York City. Alpough such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, pe freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago pat imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, pe Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform pat went into effect on January 1, 2021, and oper jurisdictions have in pe past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside pe United States. If oper jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growp could be adversely affected.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations pat are ambiguous in peir application or enforcement or pat we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogeper if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify pat our business operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, pe Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used pe Uber app, concluding pat by driving for hire wipout a Hire Car Permit, pey violated pe local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering furper legal challenges and possible policy solutions. However, pese developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As anoper example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled pat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed pe decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, pe Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furpermore, in certain of pese jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess pe applicability of pese laws and regulations to our products and offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns wip respect to our ability to comply wip pese laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in pese instances has come under investigation or has operwise been subject to scrutiny by government auporities. Our continuation of pis practice and oper past practices may result in fines or oper penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing pe risk pat our licenses or permits pat are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in pe past been, and may in pe future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make pe business decision as a gesture of\\n\\n75\\n---\\ngoodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers’ defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected. Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted. Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.9% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods. These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in financial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which could harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers\\n\\n76\\n---\\nusing dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\\n\\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\\n\\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\\n\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n\\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may block payments to Drivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received by those users. A substantial\\n---\\nincrease in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n\\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective July 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the European payments regulations.\\n\\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export restrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\\n\\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our business.\\n\\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\\n\\nWe are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other government agencies, including state AG offices in the United States and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our business practices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, data privacy and security incidents, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved the breach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and may continue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely disrupt our business. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.\\n\\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other countries.\\n\\nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior management. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to change our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm, and could result in or\\n---\\ncomplicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct investigations. Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\\n\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\n\\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach. These and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws. Such violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the subject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\\n\\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020.\\n\\n79\\n---\\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\\n\\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\\n\\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\\n\\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\\n\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n---\\n# We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\\n\\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\\n\\n# Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform.\\n\\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\n# We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\\n\\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.\\n\\n# Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\\n---\\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\\n\\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\\n\\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\\n\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\\n\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be\\n\\n82\\n---\\navailable in every country in which we currently or in the future will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be compromised by third parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we may be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n\\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,” seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions,\\n---\\nus to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

By making an RSU Election, the Director shall for all purposes be deemed conclusively to have consented to the provisions of the Program and the Equity Plan.\\n\\n## Election to Convert Compensation Into RSU Award\\n\\n4.1. RSU Election. A Director may elect to convert a designated percentage of any or all of the Director’s Compensation for services performed in a calendar year (including Compensation that would otherwise be paid in the subsequent calendar year) into an RSU Award (“RSU Election”), by properly completing and filing an RSU Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator. Each RSU Election shall become irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making an RSU Election under Section 4.2, and cannot be modified for any reason thereafter. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, an RSU Election applies solely with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in the calendar year specified in the RSU Election Form and does not apply with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in any other calendar year.\\n---\\n#### 4.2. Timing of RSU Election\\n\\n4.2.1. Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion.\\n\\n4.2.2. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make an RSU Election for services performed in the calendar year on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The RSU Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to Compensation earned with respect to services performed after the later of (a) the Effective Date, (b) the date on which the RSU Election Form is received by the Administrator, or (c) such later date as specified by the Administrator in the RSU Election Form.\\n\\n#### 4.3. Effect of RSU Election\\n\\nOn each date that Compensation would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the portion of the Compensation subject to the RSU Election (to the extent not subject to a Deferral Election) shall be converted from cash into an RSU Award by dividing the dollar amount subject to the RSU Election by the average daily closing price per Share of the Company’s common stock in the month prior to the Conversion Date to determine the number of Shares underlying the RSU Award, with any fractional Share rounded up to the next whole Share.\\n\\n#### 4.4. Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award\\n\\nTo the extent not subject to a Deferral Election, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying an RSU Award shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the Conversion Date, but in any event within 60 days following the Conversion Date.\\n\\n#### 4.5. RSU Award Subject to Terms of Equity Incentive Plan\\n\\nRSU Awards made under this Section 4 (including, for purposes of clarification, such RSU Awards that are subject to a Deferral Election) shall be issued under the Equity Plan. As such, RSU Awards and any Award Agreements governing them are subject to the Equity Plan’s terms, including, by way of example and not limitation, the Equity Plan’s terms regard tax withholding, restrictions on awards and Shares (including clawback/recovery), and corporate events.\\n\\n#### 5. Election to Defer RSUs\\n\\n5.1. Deferral Election. A Director may elect to defer the issuance of a designated percentage of any or all of the Shares underlying an RSU Award (a “Deferral Election”), with such number of Shares rounded up to the next whole Share, by properly completing and filing a Deferral Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator. Each Deferral Election shall become irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making a Deferral Election under Section 5.2, and cannot be modified for any reason thereafter, except as provided in Section 5.4 below. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, a Deferral Election applies solely with respect to (a) Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation payable for services that are performed in the calendar year specified in the Deferral Election Form and does not apply with respect to Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation.\\n---\\n## payable for services performed in any other calendar year, or (b) the RSU Award specified in the Deferral Election Form, in the case of a Non-Converted RSU Award. In the Administrator’s discretion, the RSU Election Form and the Deferral Election Form may be set forth in the same document.\\n\\n### 5.2. Timing of Deferral Election\\n\\n5.2.1. With respect to a Converted RSU Award, a Director must make a Deferral Election with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in a calendar year at the same time that an RSU Election for this Compensation may be made pursuant to Section 4.2.\\n\\n5.2.2. With respect to a Non-Converted RSU Award, generally, a Deferral Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year in which the Non-Converted RSU Award is to be issued to the Director. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make a Deferral Election with respect to the Non-Converted RSU Award on or before the date that is 30 days after the later of (a) the Effective Date, or (b) the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The Deferral Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to the portion of the Non-Converted RSU Award earned with respect to services performed on or after the date on which the Deferral Election Form is received by the Administrator.\\n\\n### 5.3. Form of Issuance\\n\\nUnless the Administrator determines otherwise, a Participant may, in the Deferral Election Form, designate that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs will be issued in either (i) a single payment or (ii) three annual installments over three years. A Participant may designate a different form of issuance with respect to each RSU Award for which the Participant makes a Deferral Election. If and to the extent that a Participant does not designate the form of issuance in the Deferral Election Form, the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs pursuant to that Deferral Election Form shall be issued as a single payment.\\n\\n### 5.4. Re-deferral Election\\n\\nIn the Administrator’s sole discretion, a Participant may elect to postpone the date of issuance of the Deferred RSUs under Section 6.2 by making an election in the form and manner specified by the Administrator (“Re-deferral Election”). A Re-deferral Election is permissible only if it defers issuance of the underlying Shares for at least five years from the year of the originally scheduled issuance date, does not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the Re-deferral Election is made, and otherwise complies with Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(b) or its successor. In the event of a Corporate Transaction or the Participant’s Disability or death, however, the underlying Shares shall be issued pursuant to Section 6.3, without regard to any Re-deferral Elections.\\n\\n## 6. Issuance of Shares under Deferred RSUs\\n\\n6.1. Issuance Upon Termination of Service. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying a Participant’s Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s termination of service, but in any case within 90 days following the date of termination of service. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether a Participant has terminated from service and the effective date of such termination.\\n---\\n## 6.2. In-Service Distribution\\n\\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement and notwithstanding Section 6.1, a Participant may elect on the Participant’s Deferral Election Form that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant on or as soon as administratively practicable after the in-service distribution date designated by the Participant in the Deferral Election Form; provided, however, that such date is after the third anniversary of the date of the Deferral Election Form, and that if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the in-service distribution date, the Shares shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) on or about the May 16 following the termination of service (or such other date as may be specified by the Administrator in accordance with Section 409A of the Code).\\n\\n## 6.3. Annual Installments\\n\\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, after the initial installment of Shares is issued, all subsequent installment of Shares shall be issued in each subsequent calendar year on the anniversary of the date upon which the initial installment of Shares was issued under Section 6.1. Each annual installment shall be calculated by dividing the number of Shares covered by the Deferred RSUs divided by three; provided, however, that if the foregoing would produce fractional Shares, the number of Shares covered under an RSU Award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share and the fractional Share will be accumulated so that the resulting whole Share(s) will be included in the number of Shares covered by the final installment.\\n\\n## 6.4. Accelerated Issuance Upon Corporate Transaction, Disability, or Death\\n\\nNotwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction or the Participant’s Disability or death, the Shares underlying all Deferred RSUs shall be issued in a single payment to the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary under Section 6.5, as applicable) as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable event, but in case within 90 days following the applicable event.\\n\\n## 6.5. Beneficiary\\n\\nA Participant may designate a beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary in the form and manner specified by the Administrator. Any beneficiary designation hereunder shall remain effective until properly changed or revoked. A beneficiary designation may be changed by the Participant at any time before the Participant’s death by filing a new designation in writing with the Administrator. If the Participant dies without having designated a beneficiary in accordance with this Section 6.5 or if the Participant dies and the beneficiary so designated by the Participant has predeceased the Participant or otherwise ceased to exist, then the Participant’s estate shall be deemed to be the beneficiary.\\n\\n## 6.6. Vesting and Issuance of Shares\\n\\nUnless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying RSU Awards representing Deferred RSUs shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable issuance date under this Section 6, but no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year containing the applicable issuance date (or, in the case of death, no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died).\\n\\n## 7. Nature of Participant’s Interest In Deferred Compensation Under the Program\\n---\\n## 7. No Right to Assets\\n\\nParticipation in the Program does not create, in favor of any Participant, any right or lien in or against any asset of the Company. Nothing contained in the Program, and no action taken under its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between the Company and a Participant or any other person. The Company’s promise to pay benefits under the Program will at all times remain unfunded as to each Participant, whose rights under the Program are limited to those of a general and unsecured creditor of the Company.\\n\\n## 7.2. No Right to Transfer Interest\\n\\nRights to benefits payable under the Program are not subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance. However, the Administrator may recognize the right of an alternate payee named in a domestic relations order to receive all or part of a Participant’s benefits under the Program, but only if (a) the domestic relations order would be a “qualified domestic relations order” within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code (if Section 414(p) applied to the Program), (b) the domestic relations order does not attempt to give the alternate payee any right to any asset of the Company, (c) the domestic relations order does not attempt to give the alternate payee any right to receive payments under the Program at a time or in an amount that the Participant could not receive under the Program, and (d) the amount of the Participant’s benefits under the Program are reduced to reflect any payments made or due to the alternate payee.\\n\\n## 7.3. No Service Rights\\n\\nNo provisions of the Program and no action taken by the Company or the Administrator will give any person any right to be retained in the service of the Company, and the Company specifically reserves the right and power to terminate the service of any Participant for any reason or no reason and at any time.\\n\\n## 8. Administration, Interpretation, and Modification of Program\\n\\n### 8.1. Program Administrator\\n\\nThe Administrator will administer all aspects of the Program. The Administrator’s powers include, but are not limited to, the power to adopt rules consistent with the Program, the power to determine requirements and limitations applicable to RSU Elections and Deferral Elections (including, without limitation, additional restrictions as to the minimum or maximum designated percentage or as to the in-service distribution date), the power to decide all questions relating to the interpretation of the terms and provisions of the Program, and the power to resolve all other questions arising under the Program (including, without limitation, the power to remedy possible ambiguities, inconsistencies, or omissions by a general rule or particular decision). The Administrator has full discretionary authority to exercise each of the foregoing powers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an RSU Award, the authority to interpret and apply the terms of the Equity Plan and any applicable Award Agreement (including the determination of the extent to which the foregoing provisions are applicable) reside in the person so authorized under the Equity Plan’s terms.\\n\\n### 8.2. Incapacity\\n\\nIf the Administrator determines that any Participant entitled to benefits under the Program is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due (unless a duly qualified guardian or other legal representative has been appointed) may be paid for the benefit of such Participant to his or her spouse, parent, brother, sister, or other party deemed by the Administrator to have incurred expenses for such Participant.\\n---\\n### 8.3. Amendment, Suspension, and Termination\\n\\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board has the right by written resolution to amend, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time, subject to the terms of this Section 8.3. After a Corporate Transaction, no amendment, suspension, or termination that reduces the benefits to which a Participant is entitled under the Program will apply to a Director who, at the time the amendment is adopted, already is a Participant without his or her express written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend the Program at any time to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, provided that, to the extent possible, such amendment does not reduce the benefits of a Participant.\\n\\n### 8.4. Power to Delegate Authority\\n\\nThe Administrator may, in its sole discretion, delegate to any person or persons all or part of its authority and responsibility under the Program.\\n\\n### 8.5. Headings\\n\\nThe headings used in this document are for convenience of reference only and may not be given any weight in interpreting any provision of the Program.\\n\\n### 8.6. Severability\\n\\nIf an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that any term, provision, or portion of the Program is void, illegal, or unenforceable, the other terms, provisions, and portions of the Program will remain in full force and effect, and the terms, provisions, and portions that are determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable will either be limited so that they will remain in effect to the extent permissible by law, or such arbitrator or court will substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar thereto or other provisions, so as to provide to the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by the Program.\\n\\n### 8.7. Governing Law\\n\\nThe Program will be construed, administered, and regulated in accordance with the laws of California (excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle), except to the extent that those laws are preempted by federal law.\\n\\n### 8.8. Complete Statement of Program\\n\\nThe Program contains a complete statement of its terms. A Participant’s right to any benefit of a type provided under the Program will be determined solely in accordance with the terms of the Program. No other evidence, whether written or oral, will be taken into account in interpreting the provisions of the Program. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 8.8, for purposes of determining the RSU Award due to a Participant, the Program will be deemed to include the applicable terms of the Equity Plan and any applicable Award Agreement.\\n\\n### 8.9. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code\\n\\nThe Program will be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Program and the benefits hereunder exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent Section 409A of the Code is applicable, (a) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under Section 409A of the Code, (b) payments to be made upon a termination of service shall only be made upon a “separation from service” under Section 409A of the Code, (c) each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and (d) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. In no event will any Participant have a right to payment or reimbursement or otherwise from the Company or its Affiliates.\\n---\\ntheir successors or assigns, for any taxes imposed or other costs incurred as a result of Section 409A of the Code.\\n\\n10\\n---\\n## Exhibit 10.2\\n\\nAMENDMENT TO THE GOOGLE MAPS MASTER AGREEMENT - PLATFORM RIDES AND DELIVERIES SOLUTION SERVICE SCHEDULE\\nThis amendment (“Amendment”) is entered into by Google LLC, whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphipeatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”); and Uber Technologies, Inc., wip offices at 1515 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94158 (\\\"Customer”).

UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nDescription of Business\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s). ” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s). ” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems. Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S. ”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia). Basis of Presentation\\n\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. ---\\n## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19\\n\\nVarious governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions. These restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"08df4dcd-f58e-4985-aded-0abca5fc003e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"08df4dcd-f58e-4985-aded-0abca5fc003e\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bbe61c8f-9a00-4780-8a14-b7c4109806ce\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"szh3LYsOwoeccqpNx4RMoYJ1686aNEtWXTWU/pCmBvs=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ed58bf84-3fe8-4948-b73b-1dddbad89ce3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"v4ES7nTAyfpfitlVUSp34RqCwTdFzvWujBgbO5W95QE=\"}},\"hash\":\"rdJakmwQAjpCuEr0Fi/iu0CQAQJ4ZMpfmjQwaT/U0Pg=\",\"text\":\"COVID-19 has produced uncertainty around the world and it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. ## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,” which requires disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if the acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements. ## Note 2 – Revenue\\n\\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region.

Additionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $88 million and $241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $339 million and $740 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Delivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services. ## Freight Revenue\\n\\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections. Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e96d2cfc-1995-429f-925d-1268f01fc1a4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e96d2cfc-1995-429f-925d-1268f01fc1a4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"69eab273-8a76-4966-bafa-6a9ee33c1ba6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"buA22jXsiY3RV47lFTS5lm9FXb9TejfpxwQpGEAwz3I=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"86a1e420-1e8d-4aad-847e-d8a552b4df9f\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"GTvlJh5gsWyIaNqRilvNiM8pf0m/TRIgCh7+lBsyZP0=\"}},\"hash\":\"lhL/4j2lD9sSVpZMZ73l0bIXcYUk2yG0foIZk/vWglM=\",\"text\":\"The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility. An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9c74d240-a865-477a-b20f-f571c7802925":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9c74d240-a865-477a-b20f-f571c7802925\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5ce942c7-1c89-45a7-8486-fd80ddb0c209\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"qVSRUdwp+gflP0haU+fgakdkb7cr5sLSMWHu8Y7F+10=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"1446fcbe-f036-47d9-afcc-cf2b4fe9bc28\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"R+Wtc3SAWY+zVM20CM1shbFotxrFY/fgb2Xhb5W5kwA=\"}},\"hash\":\"GOC55DT7C4a7QHM+QKpz6+bmRc6DbHqBafozh225u3Q=\",\"text\":\"We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

Driver Classification\\n\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\n\\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22. Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6803ca7c-2391-4c29-874d-171a7e4af782":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6803ca7c-2391-4c29-874d-171a7e4af782\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"eab89ff6-2efc-4ef8-9998-b26355ce1adc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"PggeVj027ChAgMS7PEk0TeqLXQysVTFbS/ayLkch1kw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"292a6d28-4a2c-42e3-bb1a-eac6d7996974\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"kEnTowbtvWcT2KTGdlNBDPFstGoGXmNP6FYTCR0+fxk=\"}},\"hash\":\"0XwcY44F0LptvKEaj3p0e+U/pH0I+6PI8Yr01sQwbds=\",\"text\":\"Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.

Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated. In addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.

Swiss Social Security Reclassification\\n\\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact on our current operations. A ruling on the merits by the Federal Tribunal is expected in 2023. The ultimate resolution of the matters appealed before the Federal Tribunal is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022. Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd. On October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"889d78ff-3a67-4751-856f-71db769ce21f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"889d78ff-3a67-4751-856f-71db769ce21f\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"292a6d28-4a2c-42e3-bb1a-eac6d7996974\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"kEnTowbtvWcT2KTGdlNBDPFstGoGXmNP6FYTCR0+fxk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0eb04382-fc3f-432b-9420-32ac322c38b1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"CBp+2idyKUncqpOVpun2cArLAriFaoKy3navqZU0MGo=\"}},\"hash\":\"tkWxvjZ8nbPi8mpgvi8BljZ0cwXEhbArWOqaDggNKYo=\",\"text\":\"On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law purposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022. On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay. On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March 26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.

We are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we charge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider of transportation services.

We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987.

As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora. As consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated Liquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. We do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model. We entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue to vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora.

Mobility revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Business model changes in the UK that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue also benefited Mobility revenue by $200 million. Additionally, Mobility revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers. ---\\n## Mobility Segment\\n\\nMobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by a $281 million increase in insurance expense as a result of an increase in miles driven and a $76 million increase in credit card processing costs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"39392e6f-73bd-4774-837e-ea2fdf090ddb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"39392e6f-73bd-4774-837e-ea2fdf090ddb\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2cabe2ff-ef79-45c8-abec-eaa603ee427c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LV75vMzBIb1Di7i7WBUMb7J/wA73L7jfbqpqLzSvhYU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"3b60e182-aec8-4974-a181-f62d70ebb910\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"pAmWt2C4sqgyWPDioLvGEhoYp1RG+2eed5wKCRZoteQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"YPMweLeIbWudsOJIqUMvOxb4mx8DXktiiYY2cfWxt1A=\",\"text\":\"## Delivery Segment\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Delivery revenue increased $771 million, or 44%, and Delivery adjusted EBITDA grew $230 million, or 115%. Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 15%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Take Rate improved to 18.1% from 14.0% compared to the same period in 2021 driven by an overall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided. Delivery adjusted EBITDA improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by a $387 million increase in cost of revenue as well as a $94 million increase in consumer promotions and employee headcount costs. ## Freight Segment\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Freight revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 506%, and Freight adjusted EBITDA grew $31 million, or 107%. Freight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is also driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers. Freight adjusted EBITDA improvement is attributable to a $1.5 billion improvement in Freight revenue, partially offset by $1.4 billion of certain shipper payments and incentives recorded in cost of revenue and an $88 million increase in employee headcount costs. ## Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\\n\\n### Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results. The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"212b4f6a-4713-446b-8027-c894acdcf9c2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"212b4f6a-4713-446b-8027-c894acdcf9c2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d8a52376-9b1e-4bee-91b5-fa8238cd399e\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"YsrvTQzOK3drSNT7n+vJQbqeFEhuDJPbvHWvuFY0CzE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0d9a634b-56cf-49e0-bfd4-defb1427db06\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"U7cJHi1Nm+XW6Cx0qriCqbA8kIpOKIxE0ZnWEuObb7M=\"}},\"hash\":\"r6xl6XioKBPvNuoA63Lu8CSbBIv7KktSKvlBc5VBxuc=\",\"text\":\"### Investment Risk\\n\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results. We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments. ### Foreign Currency Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0d9a634b-56cf-49e0-bfd4-defb1427db06":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0d9a634b-56cf-49e0-bfd4-defb1427db06\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"212b4f6a-4713-446b-8027-c894acdcf9c2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"r6xl6XioKBPvNuoA63Lu8CSbBIv7KktSKvlBc5VBxuc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2f368978-ce0a-4dd0-a70d-063161787c6c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5zvKDxpcXWWSuFVIbtMS8jRsC9XYt4di89EH61lfxIY=\"}},\"hash\":\"U7cJHi1Nm+XW6Cx0qriCqbA8kIpOKIxE0ZnWEuObb7M=\",\"text\":\"dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings. ## ITEM 1A.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2f368978-ce0a-4dd0-a70d-063161787c6c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2f368978-ce0a-4dd0-a70d-063161787c6c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0d9a634b-56cf-49e0-bfd4-defb1427db06\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"U7cJHi1Nm+XW6Cx0qriCqbA8kIpOKIxE0ZnWEuObb7M=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c5f5875f-b583-4f79-bac6-dbb52c8e1956\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"tPvAwhXaASpNnihiKQcoVVZx5EaXDFtBudcxarsWDZg=\"}},\"hash\":\"5zvKDxpcXWWSuFVIbtMS8jRsC9XYt4di89EH61lfxIY=\",\"text\":\"## ITEM 1A.

Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations. Operational Risks\\n\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees. The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business. In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022.

Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed. 52\\n---\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3a37b1f8-2f61-45e8-8352-dd6702e1b7fc":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3a37b1f8-2f61-45e8-8352-dd6702e1b7fc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2d6512cf-df19-42bb-8136-9c80922dbfe2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"58gCujZaOpyCJyaijRSt/KcQ3I85CzQ0Gq51t68FSw0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"102dd79b-0b17-49b5-b355-a2c27d0dd4fc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"NTWLQE+iBIwIoVqEnZMkeviAQH1cr5GW/jnhFpVsTlA=\"}},\"hash\":\"UxFhprPk7JlNz3hvjg0MBbLkwUUcsRl8geHSDHUw+Zg=\",\"text\":\"Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement. In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"102dd79b-0b17-49b5-b355-a2c27d0dd4fc":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"102dd79b-0b17-49b5-b355-a2c27d0dd4fc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3a37b1f8-2f61-45e8-8352-dd6702e1b7fc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"UxFhprPk7JlNz3hvjg0MBbLkwUUcsRl8geHSDHUw+Zg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"94bfdb2e-f592-4a83-bc25-5d6eec9535f2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"hiB1giMqiF2jf4BFPq+UGusTF9JnBT0yLg6cQlEHRbI=\"}},\"hash\":\"NTWLQE+iBIwIoVqEnZMkeviAQH1cr5GW/jnhFpVsTlA=\",\"text\":\"In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products.

Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so. In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users.

For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Public reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results. Further, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them.

These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them. We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc., which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest significant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete.

For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a88e916d-3f5d-489f-8b15-aef563231b97":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a88e916d-3f5d-489f-8b15-aef563231b97\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"766525c1-d271-4488-90e7-d13f3b5bc89b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LFaB50WApsEmD73amY3BRoihlEvmRaC0llMvahX0gD4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6837fb5f-fa09-4744-8026-f3eef53d6cd7\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"OOrTB0S+zyEDwLE5CON0rs4SzImI2Ua2LTKUKMVo8wY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"32cc937a-d8e3-4d95-9ec9-eb03a36d7b76\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"./data/uber_10q_march_2022-1.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"YrMjBnrohlQpV/L7ARNAfjoiW86aWk7VK5Ox6jNbzBE=\"}},\"hash\":\"0yuXGDSOS2t6J/13/E9muXMwndWE6f0u8g/gz52VBVI=\",\"text\":\"If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. ### If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected. To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results. ### We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics.

If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected. In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences. In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries). In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts.

In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance. Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model.

Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps.

We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.

For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.

Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 4.2.2.
